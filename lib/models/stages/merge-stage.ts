     *
     * A single field name as a string. For example:
     *
     * on: "_id"
     *
     * A combination of fields in an array. For example:
     *
     * on: [ "date", "customerId" ]
     *
     * The order of the fields in the array does not matter, and you cannot specify the same field multiple times.
     *
     * For the specified field or fields:
     *
     * The aggregation results documents must contain the field(s) specified in the on, unless the on field is the _id
     * field. If the _id field is missing from a results document, MongoDB adds it automatically.
     * The specified field or fields cannot contain a null or an array value.
     * $merge requires a unique, index with keys that correspond to the on identifier fields. Although the order of the
     * index key specification does not matter, the unique index must only contain the on fields as its keys.
     *
     * The index must also have the same collation as the aggregation’s collation.
     * The unique index can be a sparse index.
     * For output collections that already exist, the corresponding index must already exist.
     * The default value for on depends on the output collection:
     *
     * If the output collection does not exist, the on identifier must be and defaults to the _id field. The
     * corresponding unique _id index is automatically created.
     *
     * TIP
     *
     * To use a different on identifier field(s) for a collection that does not exist, you can create the collection
     * first by creating a unique index on the desired field(s). See the section on non-existent output collection for
     * an example.
     *
     * If the existing output collection is unsharded, the on identifier defaults to the _id field.
     *
     * If the existing output collection is a sharded collection, the on identifier defaults to all the shard key fields
     * and the _id field. If specifying a different on identifier, the on must contain all the shard key fields.

     * TIP
     *
     * To avoid this error, if the on field does not include the _id field, remove the _id field in the aggregation
     * results to avoid the error, such as with a preceding $unset stage, etc.

     * “keepExisting”
     *
     * Keep the existing document in the output collection.
     * “merge” (Default)
     * Merge the matching documents (similar to the $mergeObjects operator).
     *
     * If the results document contains fields not in the existing document, add these new fields to the existing
     * document.
     * If the results document contains fields in the existing document, replace the existing field values with those
     * from the results document.
     * For example, if the output collection has the document:
     *
     * { _id: 1, a: 1, b: 1 }
     *
     * $And the aggregation results has the document:
     *
     * { _id: 1, b: 5, z: 1 }

     * Then, the merged document is:
     *
     * { _id: 1, a: 1, b: 5, z: 1 }

     *
     * Starting in MongoDB 4.2.2, the $$new variable is reserved, and cannot be overridden.
